                I'm an easy going, not-long-out-of-uni Maths grad pursuing a career in tech. Four 
                years at Leeds Uni actually led me initially into an Astrophysical Fluids PhD post degree 
                but I clicked fairly sharpish that it wasn't for me. I walked away from that and took a 
                real hard look at where I wanted my career to go, leading me to where I am now!

                This website is me 'dipping my toes in the water' with respect to web-development 
                and has been great fun to put together. Its pretty vanilla but has taught me a lot about 
                the basics and given me lots of ideas as to where, and what, to turn my attention to next.

                easy access for any other projects I've got going on - but there's also a section further down

                            This website has been a great little starter project and really a lot of 
                            fun to put together.. PLUS its kept me busy/semi-productive on many lockdown 
                            evenings throughout Coronavirus. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's pretty vanilla, but has been dead useful in helping to get down with the 
                            basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript and a little JQuery. I even felt adventurous enough 
                            to put together a PHP script for the contact form which sends an email without 
                            opening up your email client.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately its ticked all my initial boxes - its served as a pretty fun 'first-foray' 
                            into web development, i've learned a lot from it and its kick started some other projects 
                            to boot! It may be simple and somewhat vanilla.. but I like it.

                            I'm pretty pants at Sudoku for someone who spent the majority of their academic life 
                            studying Maths - so I wrote a cheat code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's a pretty neat little command line solver which runs in either "solve" or "check" 
                            mode and helped cement the basics of programming in C. It prints either a full or 
                            partial solution to screen/file depending on command line arguments and whether or not 
                            a solve is possible. It implements a back-tracking algorithm and was it was real interesting 
                            to have a play with.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'd quite like to take this one a little further in the near future by way of a GUI, or probably in 
                            a Web App, to make it a little more user friendly - watch this space.

                            Having read through T.H.Cormen and Co.'s 'Introduction to Algorithms', I wanted to create a web app
                            that would help to visualise what was going on 'under the hood'.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I wanted to approach this project with a slightly more advanced methodology and decided to use the React.js
                            library coupled with Redux. It was a steep learning curve but well worth the reward as the final product
                            (to be deployed shortly) was lightning fast.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course the first algorithm I chose to use was Bubble-Sort. It was nice to get the animations moving and working
                            without having to worry about much else bar swapping elements. I went on to implement visualisations of Heap-Sort, 
                            Merge-Sort, Radix-Sort and Quick-Sort also. It was certainly easier to implement the "in-place" algorithms without having to worry 
                            about conacatentation and animation of various auxilliary arrays.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All in, a solid project with a steep learning curve but a happy end result!

                            I've definitely enjoyed creating the website and the Sudoku solver with each 
                            giving me some ideas on what to do next. I'm also currently making my way 
                            through T.H.Cormen and Co.'s "Introduction to Algorithms" and would like to 
                            incorporate at least some of the given examples into my next project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've seen a couple visualizer apps for various algorithms kicking about on 
                            the web and think something of this ilk would be pretty fun (and probably 
                            challenging) to have a go at. Most are geared at sorting algorithms or 
                            pathfinders but I think a Red-Black Tree visualizer might be interesting - we'll see.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most of the programming I've done to date has been done in C/C++ but I'd 
                            really like to get some exposure to Go and/or Python so I'll almost definitely 
                            look at a project that will allow me some exposure to one or both of these soon!
